# sticky-cards

A simple CSS project with "sticky cards".

The site shows some images of Japan, in the its cyberpunk neon colour vibes.
Using only CSS, on scrolling up or down, the images are sliding on top of one another while the base image remains sticky at the top while we are still able to see the header and footer.
